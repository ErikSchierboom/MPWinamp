# MPWinamp
A plugin for MSG Plus! which allows automatic updating of your nickname while using information from Winamp. It also allows you to control Winamp through MSN chat windows.

## Note
This is the first code that I have open sourced. The source code was originally hosted on [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mpwinamp/).

The code itself is very old, so please don't view this code as an example of how I currently code, but how I started learning how to program :)
