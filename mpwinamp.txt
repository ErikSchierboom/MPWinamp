MPWinamp Plugin v0.80 by Erik Schierboom.

This document describes how to use the MPWinamp Plugin v0.80. It lists all possible tags and commands and describes how the nickname mask can be setup. 
Note: all commands and tags are placed between "" characters.

Nickname changing commands:
"/xwinampnick"         : Update the nickname based on the current mask.
"/xwinampnick on"      : Enable the updating of the nickname.
"/xwinampnick off"     : Disable the updating of the nickname.
"/xwinampnick enable"  : Enable the updating of the nickname.
"/xwinampnick disable" : Disable the updating of the nickname.
"/xwinampnick config"  : Show the MPWinamp configuration window.
"/xwinampmask %1"      : Change the nickname mask to "%1".

The following commands all link with Winamp, thus they only have effect when Winamp is running.
"/xwinampnext"         : Play the next song.
"/xwinampprev"         : Play the previous song.
"/xwinampplay"         : Play the current song.
"/xwinamppause"        : Pause the current song.
"/xwinampstop"         : Stop the current song.
"/xwinamprepeat"       : Toggle repeat on/off.
"/xwinampshuffle"      : Toggle shuffle on/off.
"/xwinampontop"        : Toggle always on-top on/off.	
"/xwinampclose"        : Close Winamp.
"/xwinampopenfile"     : Show the open file dialog.
"/xwinampopenurl"      : Show the open URL dialog.
"/xwinampopenjtf"      : Show the jump-to-file dialog.
"/xwinampopenjtt"      : Show the jump-to-time dialog.
"/xwinampopenfileinfo" : Show the file info dialog.

The following tags are available when the MPWinamp plugin is installed:
"(!XTITLE)"       : Equals the title of the current song playing in Winamp.
"(!XARTIST)"      : Equals the artist of the current song playing in Winamp.
"(!XARTISTTITLE)" : Equals the arist - title of the current song playing in Winamp.
"(!XSONGINDEX)"   : Equals the song index of the current song playing in Winamp.
Note: when one of these tags is entered and the tag contains no value (because Winamp is not running), not text is sent.

The configuration dialog lets you change the following values. All changes have immediate effect save for the refresh rate which requires a restart of MSN Messenger.
"Enabled"       : Indicates if the plugin is enabled or disabled.
"Nickname mask" : The mask used when updating the nickname, this will be explained in detail later on.
"Refresh rate"  : The number of seconds it takes before the plugin updates the nickname. It only updates the nickname when     the new nickname is different from the previous.
"Notify"        : Indicates if the showing of the nickname change notification ('toast') is shown when the nickname is changed.

The nickname mask is nothing more than a nickname with some special tags in it which are substituted with other values. The nickname mask can contain the following direct substitution tags:
"%1" : The artist of the current song playing in Winamp.
"%2" : The title of the current song playing in Winamp.
"%3" : The combination of the current artist with the current title, separated by " - ", now playing in Winamp.
"%4" : The index of the current song in Winamp's playlist.

The following two tags are no direct substitution tags, they are formatting tags. They are there to help separate between the two possible states: Winamp is playing or Winamp is not playing. When Winamp is not playing, the beforementioned direct substitution tags lose their values and only become a hindrance. Therefore, the MPWinamp plugin supports conditional mask text to placed in the mask. All text placed between the first start tag ("%[") and the last subsequent stop tag ("%]") are only displayed when Winamp is running. If Winamp is not running the whole conditional block is not displayed.
Note 1: The last stop tag must be located after the first start tag.
Note 2: MPWinamp tries to find the largest conditional block possible, that means it searches for the first start tag it encounters as well as the last stop tag.
Note 3: The start and stop tags itself are never displayed, the merely have a formatting value.
"%[" : Start of the Winamp-running-only text.
"%]" : End of the Winamp-running-only text.

To help clarify things, a couple of example nickname masks and their resulting nicknames are shown. Both the mask and the output is placed between "" character for clarity. 

Situation 1: Winamp is playing the song "Dracula" by "Iced Earth" and it is song number "4" in the playlist.
Mask Nr.    Mask             Output
Mask 1.1:   "%1"        ->   "Iced Earth"
Mask 1.2:   "%2"        ->   "Dracula"
Mask 1.3:   "%3"        ->   "Iced Earth - Dracula"
Mask 1.4:   "%2 - %1"   ->   "Dracula - Iced Earth"
Mask 1.5:   "%4. %3"    ->   "4. Iced Earth - Dracula"

Of course, we can combine our tags with plain text (for example our 'real' nickname):
Mask Nr.    Mask                                 Output
Mask 1.6:   "MyNick (%2)"                   ->   "My Nick (Dracula)"
Mask 1.7:   "MyNick, <%1 with %3 rules!>"   ->   "MyNick, <Iced Earth with Dracula rules!>"

Situation 2: Winamp is not playing anything. We're now gonna use the start and stop tags.
Mask Nr.    Mask                                 Output
Mask 2.1:   "MyNick, not playing:%[ %2%]"   ->   "My Nick, not playing:"
Mask 2.2:   "MyNick%[%3%]                   ->   "MyNick"

Situation 3: Winamp is playing and again we're using the start and stop tags.
Mask Nr.    Mask                                Output
Mask 3.1:   "MyNick, displaying:%[ %2%]"   ->   "My Nick, playing: Dracula"
Mask 3.2:   "MyNick%[<%1>%] is cool        ->   "MyNick <Iced Earth> is cool"
